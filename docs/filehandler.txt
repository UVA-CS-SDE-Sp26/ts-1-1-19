The FileHandler program aims to fetch and read files from the data folder.
It also is able to return a String object based on the contents of the file.

Pseudocode:

input: "File_Example.txt"
if File_Example.txt is found in directory "data": return contents of File_Example.txt as a String object.
else File_Example.txt is not found in directory "data": expect FileNotFoundException.

Methods:
+getData(String): String

Tests
Files in "data" directory: File_Example.txt

1. Correct File Test // getData(File_Example.txt) // expected: contents of file returned as string. (From File_Example.txt)
2. Correct File Contents //getData(File_Example.txt) // expected: contents of the file different than the incorrect return
3. Incorrect File Test // getData(Wrong_Text_Name.txt) // expected: thrown FileNotFoundException caught as "File Not Found!"
4. Capital Sensitive Test // getData(file_example.txt) // expected: thrown FileNotFoundException caught as "File Not Found!"
5. List Files //listFiles() // expected: list all files in "data"
