Cipher Deciphering Feature

This program reads a cipher from ciphers/key.txt, which contains two lines:
1) The real alphabet
2) The cipher alphabet

The program validates that:
- The file has exactly two lines
- Both lines are the same length
- There are no duplicate characters

The decipher() method takes a ciphered string and replaces each character
with its corresponding letter from the real alphabet. Characters that are
not in the cipher (such as spaces or punctuation) are left unchanged.
